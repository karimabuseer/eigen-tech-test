Eigen Coding Task
Here at Eigen, we spend a lot of time getting useful stuff out of documents. Usually a word or two, perhaps a sentence or paragraph. For this task, we’d like you to show us how you would do something similar!

We’ve attached a few documents, each of which has lots of words and sentences. For this task, produce a list of the most frequent interesting words, along with a summary table showing where those words appear (sentences and documents). For example, like this table:

Word (Total Occurrences) | Documents | Sentences containing the word
--- | --- | ---
Philosophy (42) | x, y, z | I don't have time for philosophy
 
Surely this was a touch of fine philosophy; though no doubt he had never heard there was such a thing as that.
 
Still, her pay-as-you-go philosophy implies it.

You can be creative with the output, so feel free to format in whatever way you feel best fits your solution! 

This task can be tackled in any way you feel best solves the problem; feel free to show off your prowess! Our only “rule” is that you write your solution in Python, since that’s the main language we use at Eigen. Otherwise, please include instructions to help us get up and running with your code!
